# SDC_Notebook_002_ROI

This notebook is the second notebook corresponding to the "Computer Vision Fundamentals" of Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree, in which we begin exploring the concepts of image processing and computer vision.

In this notebook, we utilize numpy's polyfit and meshgrid functionality to select a region of interest within the frame, limiting us to a desired field of view containing only our current lane.
